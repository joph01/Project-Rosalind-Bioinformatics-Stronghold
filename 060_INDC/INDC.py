#Problem 60: Independent Segregation of Chromosomes
#Given: A positive integer nâ‰¤50.
#Return: An array A of length 2n2n in which A[k] represents the common logarithm of the probability that two diploid siblings share at least k of their 2n chromosomes (we do not consider recombination for now).
